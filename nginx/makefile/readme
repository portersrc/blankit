Makefile
"original" (not exactly) Makefile that I modified on sloppyjoe in order
to get a default nginx binary running for us.


Makefile.blankit
supplied by girish. modified to work on sloppyjoe. This is for the
instrumentation step.


Makefile.blankit.embed
supplied by girish. Makefile seems OK, in the sense that it fires off
the build. But the embed pass fails for nginx.
