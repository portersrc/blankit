create_approved_list.py
    creates an approved list.
    First iteration is to take the list of glibc routines and remove all
    the called funcs.

called_funcs.txt
    manually retrieved.
    I ran nginx with BLANKIT_TRACE=1, parsed the output, and put together
    a rough list of functions that were called.

manually_found_bad_funcs.txt
    funcs that crash nginx.
    Manually ran and reran nginx to find which funcs in the approved-list were
    still causing it to crash.

a note on function counts:
    looks like there were 14 functions that repeat in the glibc-routine-list.txt:
        fmemopen
        realpath
        regexec
        sched_getaffinity
        sched_setaffinity
        posix_spawn
        posix_spawnp
        nftw
        pthread_cond_broadcast
        pthread_cond_destroy
        pthread_cond_init
        pthread_cond_signal
        pthread_cond_wait
        pthread_cond_timedwait

    I saw 99 calls in the TRACE run, and there were 1630 funcs in the original
    approved list:
      >>> 1630 + 99 + 14
    comes to 1743 (size of the glibc routine list)

other-approved-lists
    approved lists for nginx libraries other than glibc.

complete-lists
    unmodified function lists for nginx libraries other than glibc.





approved_list.txt.orig
    list after running create-approved-list.py and removing called funcs
    (also removes functions that are listed double in glibc routine list)
    = glibc_routine_list.txt - called_funcs.txt
    --- update: 

approved_list.txt.v1
    first cut of big list that works.
    = glibc_routine_list.txt - called_funcs.txt - manually_found_bad_funcs.txt
    Notice that I haven't tried yet to re-add the called_funcs.
    I tested this with `wrk` for 30s.

approved_list.txt.v2
    = glibc_routine_list.txt - manually_found_bad_funcs.txt - doubles
    >>> 1743 - 14 - 2
    1727

approved_list.txt.v3
    same as v2 but without bzero.
    Nondeterminism must have caused me to miss this til later.

approved_list.txt.v4
    same as v3 but tuned for perf.

approved_list.txt
    list of functions to instrument at runtime.
    Gets passed to pin runtime.
