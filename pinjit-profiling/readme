grabbed this from:
ashwa:/home/prithayan/project/pintool/pin-3.6-97554-g31f0a167d-gcc-linux/source/tools/ManualExamples/proccount.cpp

Looks like Prithayan just hijacked that file to use for his pin jit profiling
runs. So we copy it into version control here.
This is also from pin 3.6, but in source/Tools/ManualExamples

To rebuild the .so, you navigate to that folder and do:
    $ make obj-intel64/proccount.so
NOTE: His tool didn't compile out-of-the-box. So I took his proccount.so from
ashwa, and I manually placed it in source/Tools/ManualExamples/obj-intel64
(not tracked here... which, if it works, might be good to put in version
control)
