A couple important notes about this one:

1. had to build it on ashwa in prithayan's folder
/home/prithayan/project/llvm/llvm5/lib/Transforms/audit/audit_runtime

2. sshd dumps its output in the communcation with the client. The normal
stdout printf version of the library doesn't work. fprintf also has issues.
stderr worked. It didn't crash sshd. The client gets some of the AUDIT_NANOSECONDS
crap but it doesn't mess up the connection.

3. prithayan's source code got modified for this, but it should be relatively
clear what i did based on filenames.
*sshd_stderr is the version that writes to stderr so that sshd will work.
