This list.txt was manually procured by reading all 95 CVEs for glibc,
recording which functions are mentioned, and then checking which of these
functions are in the glibc routine list. There must be an exact match in the
dynamic list for it to be considered. For example, "alloca" is not found and so
is discarded, even though there are multiple allocation functions. Duplicates
also play no part in the final results. We are only interested in a unique set
of functions that are both known to have vulnerabilities and known to be
executed in glibc.
